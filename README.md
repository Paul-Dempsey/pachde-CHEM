CHEM (**C**ontroller for the **H**aken **E**agan **M**atrix) is the successor to #d **HC One**.
Haken EaganMatrix firmware version 10.40 added many features and improvements to the MIDI protocol.
The changes are big enough to warrant a redesign of the modularization and user interface, hence a new plugin.

Read the [Documentation](./doc/index.md) for information on **#d CHEM**.

Special thanks to Richard Kram for encouragement, stellar docs, and testing.

## Appreciation

The pachde line of software for Eagan Matrix devices is a labor of love. The products are free to use.
Creating them requires an large investment of time and $$.
You can show appreciation for the value these tools bring to your music-making, buy making a donation or leaving a tip.

I dream of making standalone versions with responsive touch controls suitable for live performance, available for the major platforms with touch support, such as iOS, Android, and Windows. This requires an investment in $$ for the hardware, tools, and SDK licensing. Any donations you make go towards funding these prerequisites.
