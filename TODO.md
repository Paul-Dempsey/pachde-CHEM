# CHEM To-Do

## General

- MIDI-friendly control for navigating presets
  - How to simulate endless encoder on controllers without endless encoders (like NK2)?
- Integrated MIDI mapping across CHEM features for MIDI controllers.
- MPE+ to voltage module

- 10.61 HakenMidi
  - New Pedal assignments
  - New ccs for Y and Z
  - check for other new/deprecated features

- Document CHEM-kv.txt, Midilog, and all files in plugin folder.

## Core

- Bug: rounding lights aren't always same as Continuum

## After release

- Update svg_theme project to sync with all the improvements from CHEM/pachde1.

## Ideas

- Factory presets for MidiPad
- More controllers in Core
- Save unsaved Play list in patch
- Undo for _Center knobs_ (5) and _Zero modulation_ (0)
- Kinetic module (shelved for the moment - matrix may not be that useful in Rack scenario)
- Blinking or highlighted link button when not connected
- Setting files (surface, rounding, polyphony) (Rack presets sufficient?)
- Preset-associated settings (re settings files) i.e. Customize sys preset - parameters per-module
- Something for pitch tables?
