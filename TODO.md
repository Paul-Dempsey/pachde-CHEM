# CHEM To-Do

- Get Convo sync/knobs working
- Implement CV
- Global settings module (poly/mpe, mono, routing, surface, ...)
- Use expander linkage for wiring Core connection
- Research EaganMatrix::reset() -- default values for em params
- Refactor labels for just the requirements

## Before release

- Clean up unused events

- Sync Dark theme with master SVGs (no delta in appearance between Null and Dark)

- Ship Null theme? I don't realistically expect anyone to make a custom theme.
  Better for the svg_theme project.

- Update svg_theme project to sync with all the improvements from CHEM.

## Consider

- Play: Plugin scope for history
- Setting files (surface, rounding, polyphony)
- Preset-associated settings (re settings files) i.e. Customize sys preset - parameters per-module
