# CHEM To-Do

## General

- Option to suppress #d logo in browser.

- color picker
  - choose text syntax?
  - 100% transparent option
  - transparency slider

## Core

- Allow DB Save As and Load.

  — and/or —

- Option for per-connection preset lists to support multiple devices.

- Show loaded preset database.

- Bug: Switching devices always requires a reset.
- Bug: rounding lights aren't quite same as Continuum

## Preset

## Play

## MidiPad

- What might be some good factory presets?

## Overlay macros

## Osmose

## Before release

- Update doc images for final graphics/themes

- Clean up unused events

- Open issues for unresolved TODOs.

- Update svg_theme project to sync with all the improvements from CHEM.

## Ideas

- Shift moved modules back when toggling out of edit mode in XM and Midipad
- Undo for _Center knobs_ (5) and _Zero modulation_ (0)?
- Kinetic module (shelved for the moment - matrix may not be that useful in Rack scenario)
- Blinking or highlighted link button when not connected
- Setting files (surface, rounding, polyphony) (Rack presets sufficient?)
- Preset-associated settings (re settings files) i.e. Customize sys preset - parameters per-module
