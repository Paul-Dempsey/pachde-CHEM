# Kinetic Dev Note

Not sure how to control or modulate any parameters that are controlled by a formula in the preset.

Some parameters like Bow Speed have no entry in the Kinetic stream.

Given these issue, I'm omitting the Kinetic modules.
These properties are best exposed intentionally in a preset via macros, which CHEM will be able to drive.
