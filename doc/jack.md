# CHEM Jack

**Jack** selects the controls that the Pedal Jacks are assigned to.

The purple **min**/**max** knobs choose the minimum and maximum values received from the pedal.
Choosing a max smaller than the min inverts the pedal.

**Keep** turns on the EM "Preserve Pedals" setting.

The output jacks provide a CV signal for the pedal value that you can use to control additional EM features, or anything else with CV control in your Rack patch.
