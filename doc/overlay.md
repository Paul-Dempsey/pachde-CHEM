# CHEM Overlay

The **Overlay** module is used with one or more companion **XM** modules to control extended macros in an Overlay preset.
For the details on how **Overlay** and **XM** work together, see [Overlay and XM](./overlay-xm.md#chem-overlay-and-xm).

Overlay manages detection of the specific Overlay preset the patch is designed for.
Macro updates are sent only when the live preset matches the configured preset.

To set the preset that Overlay tracks, first load that preset on your instrument.
Then, in the Overlay module's right-click menu, choose _Use live preset_.
Once a preset is configured, you can select it as the live preset at any time by clicking the chiclet button under the light.

When the live preset's id matches the configured preset id, the green light at the top of Overlay turns on.

Overlay module's right-click menu also allow you to configure a custom title and set the color of the panel and the title.
