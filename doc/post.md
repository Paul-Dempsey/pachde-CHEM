# CHEM Post

**Post** contains the post-section of the Eagan Matrix, not including convolutions, which are covered in the [**Convo**](./convo.md) module.

The Yellow knob at the top is overall volume level.
Below the level knob is a global Mute button that immediately silences all audio from the device.

The Blue knob controls the mix of straight signal with equalization (EQ).

The modulation inputs and **Modulation amount** knob work the same across all CHEM modules.
See [CHEM Modulation](./modulation.md) for details.
