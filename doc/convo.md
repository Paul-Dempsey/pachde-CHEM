# CHEM Convolution

**Convolution** controls convolutions, both pre- and post- effects convolution.

The Blue knobs control the mix between the dry and processed signal for the pre-effects and post-effects IRs.
The gray **Index** knob chooses from the four convolution impulse response (IR).
An intermediary value provides an interpolation between the adjacent IRs.

For each of the 4 convolutions you can choose the parameters for applying the IR to the signal, the left/right strength, and which impule-response data to use.

The Extend button enables extended computation.

The modulation inputs and **Modulation amount** knob work the same across all CHEM modules.
See [CHEM Modulation](./modulation.md) for details.
