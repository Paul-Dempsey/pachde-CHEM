# CHEM Convo

**Convo** contains controls for comvolutions, both pre- and post- effects convolution.

The Blue knobs as always controls the mix between the dry and processed signal.
The **Index** knob chooses one of the four convolution IRs (impulse response).
An intermediary value provides an interpolation between the adjacent IRs.
