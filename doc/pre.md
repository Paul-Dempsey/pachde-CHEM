# CHEM Pre

**Pre** contains the pre-amp section of the Eagan Matrix, not including convolutions, which are covered in the [**Convo**](./convo.md) module.

Choose between **Compressor** and **Tanh** using the lollipop control.

The Yellow knob at the top is overall pre-effects level.
Even without compression, at high levels it can used for saturation and overdrive effects with some presets.

The Blue knob controls the mix of straight signal with the effects of compression or tanh saturation.

The modulation inputs and purple **Amount** knob work the same across all CHEM modules.
See [CHEM Modulation](./modulation.md) for details.
