# CHEM Pre

**Pre** contains the pre-amp section of the Eagan Matrix, not including convolutions, which are covered in the [**Convo**](./convo.md) module.

The Yellow knob at the top is overall pre-amplification level.
Even without compression, at high levels it can be used for saturation and overdrive effects.

The Blue knob controls the mix of straight signal with the effects of compression or tanh saturation.

The modulation inputs and **Modulation amount** knob work the same across all CHEM modules.
See [CHEM Modulation](./modulation.md) for details.
